### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment and make changes.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Create a feature branch in your fork for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   Work on the issue or feature you've chosen, ensuring that your code adheres to our coding standards and best practices.

4. **Test Your Changes**  
   Before submitting, ensure that your code works as expected and doesn't break existing functionality. If possible, add unit or integration tests.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   Once you're ready, submit a pull request:
   - Go to the repository's GitHub page and click **New Pull Request**.
   - Ensure that the PR description clearly explains your changes and links to the issue you're addressing.

6. **Wait for Review**

### Coding Standards

- **Follow Best Practices**: Ensure your code is clean, efficient, and follows standard best practices.
- **Code Style**: Use consistent naming conventions and indentation (we recommend 2 spaces for indentation).

   - Steps to reproduce (if reporting a bug)
   - Expected vs actual results
